# Architecture

Artemis Lost is a small full-stack app with a React frontend, a Node/Express server, and a session layer that can persist to local files or Postgres while still producing dynamic vault mirrors for prompt context.

## Runtime Responsibilities

### Frontend

The frontend owns:
- menu and character-creation flow
- current `worldState`
- active `turn`
- current narration
- local conversation history
- autosave coordination
- autonomous-turn auto-play
- event-log and role-view rendering
- mission-resolution presentation
- browser-local player identity used for save isolation

### Backend

The backend owns:
- environment validation
- session loading and saving
- vault-context assembly
- OpenAI request execution
- DM response parsing and normalization
- safe `STATE_DELTA` extraction

## World-State Contract

The current `worldState` shape is centered around:

```js
{
  mission: {
    id,
    name,
    phase,
    met,
    objectives,
    seedId,
    seedLabel,
    seedSummary,
    seedTone,
    decisionPressure,
    suggestedOpening,
  },
  environment: {
    location,
    hazards,
    anomaly,
    visibility,
    pressure,
  },
  systems: {
    o2,
    power,
    comms,
    propulsion,
    scrubber,
    thermal,
    nav,
  },
  crew: [
    {
      id,
      name,
      role,
      health,
      morale,
      extra,
      notes,
      character: {
        callSign,
        trait,
        specialty,
        flaw,
        personalStake,
        tensionNote,
        controller,
      },
    },
  ],
  eventLog: [{ ts, msg, type }],
}
```

## Mission Seed Contract

Mission seeds are data-first scenario packets. Each seed includes:

```js
{
  id,
  label,
  summary,
  tone,
  decisionPressure,
  suggestedOpening,
  mission,
  environment,
  systems,
  eventLog,
}
```

Before launch, a seed is resolved against the selected crew so placeholder text like `{engineerShort}` becomes the actual launched roster name.

## Player Insert Model

Character creation is now two-step:

- the player first claims one role by entering a name and optional callsign
- the game generates the rest of the crew around that selected role
- the chosen role starts locked and human-controlled by default
- special named overrides can still replace the callsign or bias role assignment when appropriate

## Turn And Control Model

- base turn order is round-robin across the four crew seats
- follow-through windows can now override round-robin and jump initiative to the targeted role
- each role can be `human` or `autonomous`
- human seats expose the text action input
- autonomous roles generate a role-aware action automatically and submit it through the same DM path
- the session must contain at least one human-controlled role

## Local Gameplay Systems

The frontend no longer relies only on the DM for progression. It also applies local gameplay layers after DM resolution:

- role mechanics: aligned actions create role-specific numeric benefits
- mission mechanics: certain seeds expose bespoke leverage windows with custom local bonuses
- crew coordination: handoff windows, delegation strength, and trust/friction evolve over time
- mission outcomes: deterministic win/loss evaluation runs after resolved turns
- derived UI state: action recommendations and warnings are computed from the live world state before submission

## Event Log Model

The event log is now typed and instrumented. Supported types are:
- `command`
- `system`
- `sensor`
- `trait`
- `risk`

These types are normalized in the delta parser and rendered as badges in the UI.

## Save And Vault Model

Persistent state now has separate concerns:

- the session store orchestrates slot-level save/load/delete behavior
- the storage adapter decides whether canonical saves live in local JSON files or the configured database backend
- session ownership is scoped by a browser-local player id so deployed users do not share saves
- the mirror layer writes active prompt-context artifacts into `vault/dynamic/`
- `vault/dynamic/session-state.md` keeps a handoff-friendly state snapshot
- `vault/dynamic/log.md` keeps recent conversation history
- `vault/dynamic/session.json` keeps the currently active structured session mirror

The prompt layer also loads relevant static lore from `vault/static/`.

## Prompt Contract

The DM prompt now explicitly encodes:
- structured `STATE_DELTA` output
- mission-seed pressure and atmosphere
- crew traits, flaws, stakes, and tension
- role specialization and off-role friction
- active crew coordination and follow-through context
- typed event-log expectations

Trait-driven outcomes are expected to produce `trait` log entries when personality materially affects the turn result.
