# DungeonMAIster

DungeonMAIster is a lightweight prototype for "Artemis Lost," a turn-based sci-fi roleplaying experience where a language model acts as the dungeon master for a stranded lunar mission.

The current app is a React + Vite frontend with a small Express development server that proxies requests to OpenAI. A player submits an action, the DM responds with narration plus a structured state delta, and the UI applies those changes to the shared mission state.

## Current Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite
- Backend: Express dev server
- Model provider: OpenAI API
- State model: in-memory world state with delta-based updates

## Getting Started

### Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI credentials:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
DM_API_PORT=8787
```

3. Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

What this does:
- starts the Vite frontend
- starts the local DM API server at `localhost:8787`
- proxies frontend `/api` requests to the local DM server

### Build And Preview

To test the production build locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then open the preview URL printed by Vite in your terminal.

### Opening The Built HTML Directly

The build now uses relative asset paths, so [dist/index.html](/Users/jacquelinehenriksen/DungeonMAIster/dist/index.html) can be opened directly to inspect the UI shell.

However, direct file opening is only suitable for static UI viewing. DM turn requests to `/api/turn` still require a running server setup, so interactive gameplay should be tested with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or:

```bash
npm run preview
```

with the DM API server running.

## How It Works

1. The frontend renders a seeded mission state and a role-based UI.
2. A player enters an action for the active crew member.
3. The frontend includes recent conversation history and the current turn index when posting to `/api/turn`.
4. The Express server calls OpenAI with a structured system prompt.
5. The server enriches the prompt with vault content and validates the model output.
6. The model returns JSON containing:
   - `narration`
   - `stateDelta`
7. The frontend merges `stateDelta` into the current world state, advances the turn, and persists the updated session.

## Current Status

The prototype already includes:
- a seeded mission world state
- role-specific UI panels
- DM narration rendering
- event log updates
- state-delta application
- OpenAI-backed turn requests through a local server
- conversation history passed through the DM loop
- vault-backed session persistence in `vault/dynamic`
- prompt context assembled from `vault/static`
- centralized shared UI styling in `src/styles.css`

The next natural improvements are:
- adding a visible "reset session" control in the UI
- surfacing session save/load status to the player
- expanding vault-driven prompt assembly with more scene-aware file selection

## Notes

The current implementation keeps most gameplay logic in [src/UI.jsx](/Users/jacquelinehenriksen/DungeonMAIster/src/UI.jsx), which makes iteration fast but leaves room for cleanup as the prototype grows.
